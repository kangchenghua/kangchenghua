👋 Hi, I am Kang Chenghua, a Year 3 student pursuing a Diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (CDF) at the School of Informatics & IT at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), expected to graduate in 2022.

👀 In my course of studies, I learned about the key principles of information security namely confidentiality, integrity, and availability to protect IT systems against cyber-attacks and information breaches, and the architecture and organisation of the digital components of a computer system. I am also experienced in the concept and techniques required to discover and investigate the evidence from various digital storage devices

🌱 I strive to deepen my knowledge in this field and enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it.
